    <h2>Dear Bishal,</h2>

    <p>I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits! I wanted to share with you how my summer holidays
        went this year.</p>

    <p>My summer holidays were truly wonderful and memorable. I spent the first few days relaxing at home, catching up
        on my favorite books and TV shows. It felt so good to have a break from studies and just unwind.</p>

    <p>Later, my family and I went on a short trip to Shimla. The weather was perfect, and the scenery was breathtaking.
        We visited some beautiful spots, tried delicious local food, and took lots of pictures. I especially enjoyed the
        sightseeing.</p>

    <p>Apart from traveling, I also picked up a new hobby painting! I spent many afternoons experimenting with colors
        and brushes. It was so much fun and helped me relax. I even made a few paintings that I am quite proud of.</p>

    <p>Of course, I didnot forget to spend time with friends. We played cricket in the evenings and even had a small
        picnic in the park. Those moments were full of laughter and joy.</p>

    <p>Now that the holidays are over, I feel refreshed and ready for the new school term. I hope you also had a
        fantastic summer. I had love to hear all about your adventures!</p>

    <p>Take care and write back soon.</p>

    <p>Your friend,<br>
        Soumya</p>
